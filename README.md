NVGTools
========

The NATO Vector Graphics format was developed as a means for NATO systems to share and use overlays. The format is based on SVG.

## nvgReader.py ##

Provides a means to read a nvg file and output feature classes to a file geodatabase.

This code is in active development and a beta release is targeted for early May 2015. This will focus on reading nvg version 1.4.0 into file geodatabases.

Future versions will be supported as the tools develop. In addition a means to write nvg from file geodatabase will be developed.

## Contributing ##

Please feel free to contribute to the code. I am happy to include ideas people may have for additional functionality. The best way to do this is to either use the fork and pull workflow or raise an issue and I will attempt to add the required functionality.
