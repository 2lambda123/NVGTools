## Python Toolbox

The NVG.pyt provides a smaple toolbox that demonstrates reading one or more NVG files into file geodatabase feature classes.

The example is not the best implementation as it curently creates feature classes for each returned type regardless of whether there are any features returned.
This functionality will be added at a later point.

### Note

The accompanying xml files should not be editied directly. These are maintained by ArcGIS.
